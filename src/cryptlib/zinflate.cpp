/*
   Inflate deflated (PKZIP's method 8 compressed) data.  The compression
   method searches for as much of the current string of bytes (up to a
   length of 258) in the previous 32K bytes.  If it doesn't find any
   matches (of at least length 3), it codes the next byte.  Otherwise, it
   codes the length of the matched string and its distance backwards from
   the current position.  There is a single Huffman code that codes both
   single bytes (called "literals") and match lengths.  A second Huffman
   code codes the distance information, which follows a length code.  Each
   length or distance code actually represents a base value and a number
   of "extra" (sometimes zero) bits to get to add to the base value.  At
   the end of each deflated block is a special end-of-block (EOB) literal/
   length code.  The decoding process is basically: get a literal/length
   code; if EOB then done; if a literal, emit the decoded byte; if a
   length then get the distance and emit the referred-to bytes from the
   sliding window of previously emitted data.

   There are (currently) three kinds of inflate blocks: stored, fixed, and
   dynamic.  The compressor deals with some chunk of data at a time, and
   decides which method to use on a chunk-by-chunk basis.  A chunk might
   typically be 32K or 64K.  If the chunk is uncompressible, then the
   "stored" method is used.  In this case, the bytes are simply stored as
   is, eight bits per byte, with none of the above coding.  The bytes are
   preceded by a count, since there is no longer an EOB code.

   If the data is compressible, then either the fixed or dynamic methods
   are used.  In the dynamic method, the compressed data is preceded by
   an encoding of the literal/length and distance Huffman codes that are
   to be used to decode this block.  The representation is itself Huffman
   coded, and so is preceded by a description of that code.  These code
   descriptions take up a little space, and so for small blocks, there is
   a predefined set of codes, called the fixed codes.  The fixed method is
   used if the block codes up smaller that way (usually for quite small
   chunks), otherwise the dynamic method is used.  In the latter case, the
   codes are customized to the probabilities in the current block, and so
   can code it much better than the pre-determined fixed codes.

   The Huffman codes themselves are decoded using a mutli-level table
   lookup, in order to maximize the speed of decoding plus the speed of
   building the decoding tables.  See the comments below that precede the
   lbits and dbits tuning parameters.

/* Macros for inflate() bit peeking and grabbing.
   The usage is:

        NEEDBITS(j)
        x = b & mask_bits[j];
        DUMPBITS(j)

   where NEEDBITS makes sure that b has at least j bits in it, and
   DUMPBITS removes the bits from b.  The macros use the variable k
   for the number of bits in b.  Normally, b and k are register
   variables for speed, and are initialized at the beginning of a
   routine that uses these macros from a global bit buffer and count.

   If we assume that EOB will be the longest code, then we will never
   ask for bits with NEEDBITS that are beyond the end of the stream.
   So, NEEDBITS should not read any more bytes than are needed to
   meet the request.  Then no bytes need to be "returned" to the buffer
   at the end of the last block.

   However, this assumption is not true for fixed blocks--the EOB code
   is 7 bits, but the other literal/length codes can be 8 or 9 bits.
   (The EOB code is shorter than other codes because fixed blocks are
   generally short.  So, while a block always has an EOB, many other
   literal/length codes have a significantly lower probability of
   showing up at all.)  However, by making the first table have a
   lookup of seven bits, the EOB code will be found in that first
   lookup, and so will not require that too many bits be pulled from
   the stream.

/*
   Huffman code decoding is performed using a multi-level table lookup.
   The fastest way to decode is to simply build a lookup table whose
   size is determined by the longest code.  However, the time it takes
   to build this table can also be a factor if the data being decoded
   is not very long.  The most common codes are necessarily the
   shortest codes, so those codes dominate the decoding time, and hence
   the speed.  The idea is you can have a shorter table that decodes the
   shorter, more probable codes, and then point to subsidiary tables for
   the longer codes.  The time it costs to decode the longer codes is
   then traded against the time it takes to make longer tables.

   This results of this trade are in the variables lbits and dbits
   below.  lbits is the number of bits the first level table for literal/
   length codes can decode in one step, and dbits is the same thing for
   the distance codes.  Subsequent tables are also less than or equal to
   those sizes.  These values may be adjusted either when all of the
   codes are shorter than that, in which case the longest code length in
   bits is used, or when the shortest code is *longer* than the requested
   table size, in which case the length of the shortest code in bits is
   used.

   There are two different values for the two tables, since they code a
   different number of possibilities each.  The literal/length table
   codes 286 possible values, or in a flat code, a little over eight
   bits.  The distance table codes 30 possible values, or a little less
   than five bits, flat.  The optimum values for speed end up being
   about one bit more than those, so lbits is 8+1 and dbits is 5+1.
   The optimum values may differ though from machine to machine, and
   possibly even between compilers.  Your mileage may vary.
