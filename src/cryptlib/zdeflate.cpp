 *  deflate.c by Jean-loup Gailly.
 *
 *  PURPOSE
 *
 *      Identify new text as repetitions of old text within a fixed-
 *      length sliding window trailing behind the new text.
 *
 *  DISCUSSION
 *
 *      The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions
 *      of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
 *      sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
 *
 *      The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
 *      most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
 *      The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
 *      dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
 *      completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
 *      string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
 *      is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
 *      insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
 *      strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach
 *      is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
 *      A similar algorithm is used in comic (by Jan-Mark Wams) and freeze
 *      (by Leonid Broukhis).
 *         A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
 *      (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
 *      time, but has a larger average cost, uses more memory and is patented.
 *      However the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant
 *      files if the parameter max_chain_length (described below) is too large.
 *
 *  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 *
 *      The idea of lazy evaluation of matches is due to Jan-Mark Wams, and
 *      I found it in 'freeze' written by Leonid Broukhis.
 *      Thanks to many info-zippers for bug reports and testing.
